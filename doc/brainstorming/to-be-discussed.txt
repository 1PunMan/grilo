1.- Should we use typed keys?
    -> Is a significant effort, but is it worth it?
       -> Does it really make somebody else's live easier?
          -> Check for use cases where that would be the case
             -> Are these use cases important enough?
       -> The alternative, all keys are string type.
          -> Simple implementation and usage.
          -> But would we be lacking flexibility or power somehow?
             -> Again check use cases.
