1.- Should we use typed keys?
    -> Is a significant effort, but is it worth it?
       -> Does it really make somebody else's live easier?
          -> Check for use cases where that would be the case
             -> Are these use cases important enough?
       -> The alternative, all keys are string type.
          -> Simple implementation and usage.
          -> But would we be lacking flexibility or power somehow?
             -> Again check use cases.

2.- Should MetadataKey should used as high level entity in API?
    -> So far, API handles only key ids.
    -> For instance, we have content_get(Content *c, gint KeyId)
       -> Should be good/interesting handling MetadataKey directly?
       -> Like content_get(Content *c, MetadataKey *key)

    -> It would require to have an API to get the MetadataKey for artist, album,
       and so on.
    -> But keys would carry with them all information that any one could use.
