- Some keys may be slow to resolve only in cetain circumstances.
  Example: childcount for fixed categories maybe be immediate, but
  for dynamic ones maybe expensive: only the plugin dev knows when
  resolving the key is expensive or not.
  - Passing the list of flags to the plugin developer allows him to
    decide if he should resolve a particular key or not based on how
    expensive it is in the current context.
    - Keys that are expensive only sometimes, could be ommitted from
      the slow keys method and be resolved in the plugin itself or not
      according to the context and the passed flags.
