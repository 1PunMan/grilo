- Expensive metadata, maybe use flags to decide if we want to resolve these.
  - Example: childcount for youtube categories implies http query per category and
    some xml parsing. If the user browses all categories this would be a very expensive
    operation.
    - Solution 1: do not implement this key in this source.
    - Solution 2: Use flags to select only-fast-keys operation mode.
